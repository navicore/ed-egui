# Project Status

## What's Implemented

- Basic project structure with modular architecture
- Core editor widget with egui integration
- Simple text buffer with basic editing operations
- Mode switching between Vim and Emacs
- Basic key bindings for both Vim and Emacs modes:
  - Vim: Normal/Insert mode switching, basic navigation, deletion
  - Emacs: Basic navigation with Ctrl modifiers
- Simple syntax highlighting for markdown headings and comments
- Status bar showing current mode and cursor position
- Sample applications demonstrating the editor

## Example Applications

1. **Basic Editor** - A simple editor with Vim/Emacs modes and basic syntax highlighting
2. **Minimal** - A minimal test of the egui integration with keyboard input monitoring

## Running the Examples

```bash
# Run the basic editor example
cargo run --example basic_editor --features eframe-demo

# Run the minimal example
cargo run --example minimal --features eframe-demo
```

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the project are:

1. **Improve Cursor Navigation**
   - Implement line-based navigation (up/down)
   - Add word-level movement
   - Implement page movement

2. **Enhance Text Editing**
   - Implement text selection
   - Add copy/paste operations
   - Implement undo/redo

3. **Extend Vim Mode**
   - Add visual mode for selection
   - Implement more normal mode commands
   - Support operators and motions

4. **Extend Emacs Mode**
   - Add region-based editing
   - Implement more key chords
   - Support kill ring operations

5. **Syntax Highlighting**
   - Support multiple languages in code blocks
   - Implement proper markdown parsing
   - Add more token types and styles
